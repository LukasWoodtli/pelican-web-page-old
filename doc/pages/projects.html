<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h1>
<h2 id="profidata-ag">Profidata <span class="caps">AG</span></h2>
<p>Currently I am working as a senior software developer at Profidata. My current task there is to ensure software quality of the highly scalable and parallelized server application Xentis. 
I implemented system tests to check our <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span>’s as well as integration tests and unit tests. To test a big legacy application I found that characterization tests help to increase code quality and capture current behavior. With my experience in quality
software design and testing techniques I support other developer’s with testing and refactoring the huge legacy codebase.</p>
<p>Previous tasks included the extension of the Xentis server application with <span class="caps">REST</span> services. This enables other systems to
use the functionality of Xentis outside of the core application.
I also worked on the implementation of different functional modules such as investment performance and price services. </p>
<p>The development is done with modern and generic C++ on Linux and with Java. Part of the testing infrastructure is written in Python.</p>
<p>I am also learning a lot about financial markets, investment and FinTech.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of mine is the maintenance of our build environment and continuous integration infrastructure (CMake, Jenkins pipeline, Gerrit), integration of static and dynamic analysis tools (Sanitizers, Clang Static Analyzer), as well as regression- and unit-tests. I also became an expert in development on Linux.</p>

<h3 id="portable-programming-device">Portable Programming Device</h3>
<p>At first I was responsible for the development of the firmware for a programming device. The programmer consists of a lot of peripheral devices including a <span class="caps">LCD</span> display, a keypad, <span class="caps">NFC</span>, <span class="caps">USB</span>, <span class="caps">RS</span>-232 and <span class="caps">SD</span> card. It runs on an <span class="caps">ARM</span> controller. The firmware was developed in C.</p>
<h3 id="electronic-locks">Electronic Locks</h3>
<p>Later I was involved in the embedded software development of electronic locks that were based on different micro controller architectures, such as <span class="caps">ARM</span> Cortex, ATmega and Coldfire. I extended and maintained the firmware that was written in C. Later it was decided to rewrite the embedded software using C++ for it.</p>
<p>Beside my role as a programmer, I acted as the main software architect on this project, driving the development of a modular, object oriented design. It was designed for usability, testability, extensibility and reuse. To enforce quality and security, system- and unit-tests were implemented with a Test Driven Development approach. I also mentored and supported my colleagues on how to use C++ in an embedded, battery driven environment with with low resources.</p>
<p>All these devices contained different peripherals, such as <span class="caps">NFC</span> readers, <span class="caps">EEPROM</span>, ZigBee, <span class="caps">USB</span> and motors, which were connected by common digital communication interfaces. My team also extended and maintained <span class="caps">PC</span> simulations for all devices (firmware and hardware) to simplify development, testing and bug fixing.</p>
<h3 id="other-tasks">Other Tasks</h3>
<p>Besides programming, I defined functional requirements, specifications and maintained documentation. Moreover, I was the project manager in charge of developing a customer specific device.</p>

<h2 id="codecheck-ag">CodeCheck <span class="caps">AG</span></h2>
<p>As a small project at CodeCheck I developed a
complete mobile app for Symbian with Qt and C++. Learned a lot about development for mobile platforms and <span class="caps">REST</span> services. Improved my C++ and Qt skills. In the process of developing the app I also ported a barcode scanner from Objective-C to C++.</p>
<h2 id="schiller-ag">Schiller <span class="caps">AG</span></h2>
<p>After my studies as electronic engineer I worked as an intern at Schiller.
There I created an application for the configuration and combination of filters for electrocardiograph devices (<span class="caps">ECG</span>). </p>
<p>The software reads the configuration from a <span class="caps">XML</span> file and shows it graphically as connected boxes which represent the filters. The configuration can be stored again in a <span class="caps">XML</span> file. For creating and editing configurations the filters are placed on a workspace via drag and drop and they can be connected with mouse clicks.</p>
<p>The application was developed in C++ with Qt, Boost and Xerces for Windows and Linux.
Beside improving my C++ skills I also learned a lot of general programming tools and techniques as Design Patterns, <span class="caps">OOA</span>/<span class="caps">OOD</span>, <span class="caps">UML</span>, <span class="caps">XML</span> (<span class="caps">SAX</span>/<span class="caps">DOM</span>), Doxygen.
I not only learned a lot of technical stuff but also about medical engineering.
As side projects I set up automated integration testing for the <span class="caps">GUI</span> of an <span class="caps">ECG</span> application and evaluated installer tools for Windows and Linux.</p>
<h2 id="aim-industrielle-montage"><span class="caps">AIM</span> Industrielle Montage</h2>
<p>After my apprenticeship I worked at <span class="caps">AIM</span> as mechanical engineer.
There I assembled mechanical devices and fabricated small series and individual mechanical parts. I also made some improvements on existing parts.
An other task was to manage the warehouse of mechanical parts and devices (logistics).</p>
<h1 id="educational-projects">Educational Projects</h1>
<h2 id="bachelor-thesis">Bachelor Thesis</h2>
<p>The task of my Bachelor thesis was to develop and build a quad copter in the shape of a film reel to entertain visitors at Disneyland.</p>
<p>The project was a cooperation between the Autonomous Systems Lab at the <span class="caps">ETH</span> and the <span class="caps">ZHAW</span>, where I obtained my degree in Electrical Engineering.
We were an interdisciplinary team of electrical and mechanical engineers.</p>
<p>My task was to develop the firmware and create the controlling algorithm for the embedded hardware. The hardware, based on two micro controllers, had many different peripheral devices, such as gyroscopes, a compass, pressure-, ultrasonic- and acceleration-sensors, as well as the motors to drive the propellers. Different interfaces were used for communication with the peripheral devices, such as <span class="caps">UART</span>, <span class="caps">SPI</span>, <span class="caps">I2C</span>, <span class="caps">ADC</span> and ZigBee.</p>
<p>The bachelor thesis was rewarded with a grade of <strong>5.5</strong> (of 6).</p>
<p>More information on the project can be found on the homepage: <a href="http://www.reely.ethz.ch">www.reely.ethz.ch</a></p>
<h1 id="private-projects">Private Projects</h1>
<h2 id="robot">Robot</h2>
<p>Recently I started to build a robot based on <span class="caps">ROS</span>. It is still in a very early stage. As I will make more progress, I am going to write about it in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="web-page">Web Page</h2>
<p>Currently I’m building a new Web Page using Angular and Typescript. This way I learn a lot
about front-end development and design. I also do some unit- and e2e-testing using Jasmin,
Karma and Cypress.</p>
<h2 id="px4-firmware-for-drones"><span class="caps">PX4</span> Firmware for Drones</h2>
<p>From time to time I’m contributing to the <a href="https://px4.io/"><span class="caps">PX4</span></a> project. It provides an open source auto pilot firmware for drones. The framework is used in several
commercial and industrial applications.</p>
