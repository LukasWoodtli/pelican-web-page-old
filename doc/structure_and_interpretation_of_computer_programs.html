<h1 id="1-building-abstractions-with-procedures">1 Building Abstractions with Procedures</h1>
<h2 id="11-the-elements-of-programming">1.1 The Elements of Programming</h2>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>[The] language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.  Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>primitive expressions</strong>, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,</em></li>
<li><em><strong>means of combination</strong>, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and</em></li>
<li><em><strong>means of abstraction</strong>, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.”</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="113-evaluating-combinations">1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>To evaluate a combination, do the following:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.</em></li>
<li><em>Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands).</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>[…] first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is </em><em>recursive</em><em> in nature”</em></p>
<h3 id="115-the-substitution-model-for-procedure-application">1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application</h3>
<h4 id="applicative-order-versus-normal-order">Applicative order versus normal order</h4>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>[The] interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>[An] alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the operands until their values were needed. Instead it would first substitute operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and would then perform the evaluation.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>This alternative ‘fully expand and then reduce’ evaluation method is known as </em><em>normal-order evaluation</em><em>, in contrast to the ‘evaluate the arguments and then apply’ method that the interpreter actually uses, which is called </em><em>applicative-order evaluation</em><em>.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Lisp obeys the convention that every expression has a value.”</em></p>
<h3 id="121-linear-recursion-and-iteration">1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In the iterative case, the program variables provide a complete description of the state of the process at any point.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive </em><em>process</em><em> with the notion of a recursive </em><em>procedure</em><em> . When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers (either directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself. But when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure is written.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be confusing is that most implementations of common languages (including Ada, Pascal, and C) are designed in such a way that the interpretation of any recursive procedure consumes an amount of memory that grows with the number of procedure calls, even when the process described is, in principle, iterative. As a consequence, these languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to special-purpose ‘looping constructs’ such as <code>do</code>, <code>repeat</code>, <code>until</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code>.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>any iterative process can be realized ‘in hardware’ as a machine that has a fixed set of registers and no auxiliary memory. In contrast, realizing a recursive process requires a machine that uses an auxiliary data structure known as a </em><em>stack</em><em>.”</em></p>
<h2 id="13-formulating-abstractions-with-higher-order-procedures">1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="132-constructing-procedures-using-lambda">1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using <code>lambda</code></h3>
<h4 id="using-let-to-create-local-variables">Using <code>let</code> to create local variables</h4>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>we could use a lambda expression to specify an anonymous procedure for binding our local variables</em></p>
<p><em>The general form of a <code>let</code> expression is</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">let</span>
   <span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">&lt;var</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">&lt;exp</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="nv">&lt;body&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>the <code>let</code> expression is interpreted as an alternate syntax for</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">((</span><span class="k">lambda </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;var</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">&gt;</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="nv">&lt;var</span> <span class="nv">n&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="nv">&lt;exp</span> <span class="nv">n&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>No new mechanism is required in the interpreter in order to provide local variables. A <code>let</code> expression is simply syntactic sugar for the underlying lambda application.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span><code>Let</code> allows one to bind variables as locally as possible to where they are to be used.”</em></p>
<h4 id="abstractions-and-first-class-procedures">Abstractions and first-class procedures</h4>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have first-class status.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Some of the ‘rights and privileges’ of first-class elements are:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>They may be named by variables.</em></li>
<li><em>They may be passed as arguments to procedures.</em></li>
<li><em>They may be returned as the results of procedures.</em></li>
<li><em>They may be included in data structures.”</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-building-abstractions-with-data">2 Building Abstractions with Data</h1>
<h3 id="213-what-is-meant-by-data">2.1.3 What Is Meant by Data?</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In general, we can think of data as defined by some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>we could implement <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, and <code>cdr</code> without using any data structures at all but only using procedures. Here are the definitions:</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cons </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2 id="22-hierarchical-data-and-the-closure-property">2.2 Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property</h2>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list structure’s importance as a representational tool. We refer to this ability as the </em><em>closure property</em><em> of cons. In general, an operation for combining data objects satisfies the closure property if the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation.”</em></p>
<h3 id="223-sequences-as-conventional-interfaces">2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces</h3>
<h4 id="sequence-operations">Sequence Operations</h4>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The key to organizing programs so as to more clearly reflect the signal-flow structure is to concentrate on the ‘signals’ that flow from one stage in the process to the next. If we represent these signals as lists, then we can use list operations to implement the processing at each of the stages.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this helps us make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that are constructed by combining relatively independent pieces. We can encourage modular design by providing a library of standard components together with a conventional interface for connecting the components in flexible ways.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word “closure” to describe a totally unrelated concept: A closure is an implementation technique for representing procedures with free variables.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Unlike Lisp with its pairs, these languages have no built-in general-purpose glue that makes it easy to manipulate compound data in a uniform way.”</em></p>
<h1 id="3-modularity-objects-and-state">3 Modularity, Objects, and State</h1>
<h2 id="31-assignment-and-local-state">3.1 Assignment and Local State</h2>
<h3 id="311-local-state-variables">3.1.1 Local State Variables</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The <code>set!</code> special form, whose syntax is:”</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set! </span><span class="nv">&lt;name&gt;</span> <span class="nv">&lt;new-value&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Here <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is a symbol and <code>&lt;new-value&gt;</code> is any expression.
<code>Set!</code> changes <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> so that its value is the result obtained by
evaluating <code>&lt;new-value&gt;</code>.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The value of a <code>set!</code> expression is implementation-dependent. <code>Set!</code> should be used only for its effect, not for its value.”</em></p>
<h3 id="312-the-benefits-of-introducing-assignment">3.1.2 The Benefits of Introducing Assignment</h3>

<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Once we admit assignment into our programming language […], a variable can no longer be considered to be merely a name for a value.

<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>An environment is a sequence of frames. Each frame is a table (possibly empty) of bindings, which associate variable names with their corresponding values.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Each frame also has a pointer to its enclosing environment […]. The value of a variable with respect to an environment is the value given by the binding of the variable in the first frame in the environment that contains a binding for that variable. If no frame in the sequence specifies a binding for the variable, then the variable is said to be unbound in the environment.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Indeed, one could say that expressions in a programming language do not, in themselves, have any meaning. Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in which it is evaluated.”</em></p>
<h3 id="321-the-rules-for-evaluation">3.2.1 The Rules for Evaluation</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In the environment model of evaluation, a procedure is always a pair consisting of some code and a pointer to an environment. Procedures are created in one way only: by evaluating a <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>-expression. This produces a procedure whose code is obtained from the text of the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>-expression and whose environment is the environment in which the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>-expression was evaluated to produce the procedure.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In general, <code>define</code> creates definitions by adding bindings to frames.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Now that we have seen how procedures are created, we can describe how procedures are applied. The environment model specifies: To apply a procedure to arguments, create a new environment containing a frame that binds the parameters to the values of the arguments. The enclosing environment of this frame is the environment specified by the procedure. Now, within this new environment, evaluate the procedure body.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The environment model of procedure application can be summarized by two rules:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by constructing a frame, binding the formal parameters of the procedure to the arguments of the call, and then evaluating the body of the procedure in the context of the new environment constructed. The new frame has as its enclosing environment the environment part of the procedure object being applied.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A procedure is created by evaluating a <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>-expression relative to a given environment. The resulting procedure object is a pair consisting of the text of the <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>-expression and a pointer to the environment in which the procedure was created.”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>We also specify that defining a symbol using <code>define</code> creates a binding in the current environment frame and assigns to the symbol the indicated value.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Evaluating the expression (<code>set! &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code>) in some environment locates the binding of the variable in the environment and changes that binding to indicate the new value. That is, one finds the first frame in the environment that contains a binding for the variable and modifies that frame. If the variable is unbound in the environment, then <code>set!</code> signals an error.”</em></p>

<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The job of the evaluator is not to specify the primitives of the language, but rather to

<li><em>An assignment to (or a definition of) a variable must recursively call eval to compute the new value to be associated with the variable. The environment must be modified to change (or create) the binding of the variable.</em></li>
<li><em>An <code>if</code> expression requires special processing of its parts, so as to evaluate the consequent if the predicate is true, and otherwise to evaluate the alternative.</em></li>

In contrast, </em><em>normal-orde</em><em>r languages delay evaluation of

<h2 id="43-variations-on-a-scheme-nondeterministic-computing">4.3 Variations on a Scheme - Nondeterministic Computing</h2>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>With nondeterministic evaluation, an expression
represents the exploration of a set of possible worlds,
each determined by a set of choices. Some of the possible
worlds lead to dead ends, while others have useful values.
The nondeterministic program evaluator supports the illusion
that time branches, and that our programs have different
possible execution histories. When we reach a dead
end, we can revisit a previous choice point and proceed
along a different branch.”</em></p>
<h3 id="431-amb-and-search">4.3.1 Amb and Search</h3>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Abstractly, we can imagine that evaluating an <code>amb</code> expression
causes time to split into branches, where the
computation continues on each branch with one of the
possible values of the expression. We say that <code>amb</code> represents
a nondeterministic choice point.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>It is better to </em><em>systematically search</em><em> all possible execution paths.
The amb evaluator […] implements a systematic search as follows:
When the evaluator encounters an application of `amb, it
initially selects the first alternative. This selection may itself
lead to a further choice. The evaluator will always initially
choose the first alternative at each choice point. If
a choice results in a failure, then the evaluator </em><em>automagically</em><em>
backtracks to the most recent choice point and tries
the next alternative.”</em></p>

<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The evaluation of an ordinary Scheme expression may return
a value, may never terminate, or may signal an error.
In nondeterministic Scheme the evaluation of an expression

end, in which case evaluation must backtrack to a previous
choice point. The interpretation of nondeterministic
Scheme is complicated by this extra case.”</em></p>
<h4 id="execution-procedures-and-continuations">Execution procedures and continuations</h4>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>Recall that the execution procedures for the ordinary evaluator
take one argument: the environment of execution.
In contrast, the execution procedures in the <code>amb</code> evaluator
take three arguments: the environment, and two procedures
called </em><em>continuation procedures</em><em>. The evaluation of
an expression will finish by calling one of these two continuations:
If the evaluation results in a value, the </em><em>success
continuation</em><em> is called with that value; if the evaluation results
in the discovery of a dead end, the </em><em>failure continuation</em><em>
is called.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>The failure continuation
in hand at that point will cause the most recent choice
point to choose another alternative. If there are no more
alternatives to be considered at that choice point, a failure
at an earlier choice point is triggered, and so on.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>In addition, if a side-effect operation (such as assignment
to a variable) occurs on a branch of the process resulting
from a choice, it may be necessary, when the process
finds a dead end, to undo the side effect before making
a new choice.”</em></p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">“</span>When the failure continuation for an <code>amb</code> runs out of
choices, it calls the failure continuation that was originally

library of subroutines written in the native language of the given machine. A
